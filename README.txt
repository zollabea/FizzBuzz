**    TO RUN: Run FizzBuzz.bat file.   **
*******************************************
 
*********************
**   INSTRUCTIONS  **
*********************
1.If the value is a multiple of 3 then output the word “Fizz” 

2.If the value is a multiple of 5 then output the word “Buzz” 

3.If the value is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word “FizzBuzz” 

4.At the end of the run the program should display each division that was performed. See Sample Output below.

Sample input:  
[1, 3, 5 , , 15, A, 23]
Sample Output: 
Divided 1 by 3 
Divided 1 by 5 
Fizz
Buzz
Invalid Item
FizzBuzz
Invalid Item
Divided 23 by 3 
Divided 23 by 5

**   ASSUMPTIONS MADE   **
**************************

Normally, I would not make any assumptions but would get clarifications before starting development. But since that was given as an option for this assignment, I decided to make the following assumptions, based on the sample input and output.  

1. The instructions say to display each division that was performed, but the sample output shows only displaying the division for integers that were not divisible by 3 or 5, so I decided to match the input/output sample.

2. The instructions say to display each division that was performed at the end of the run, but the sample shows this displayed during the run, along with the Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz output. Again, I decided to match the input/output sample. 

3. I assumed that the desired input is an integer, and all other input will be considered an "Invalid Item."
